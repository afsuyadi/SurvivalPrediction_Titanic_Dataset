Hello, welcome to my first machine-learning project. Basically, this project is based on the well-known titanic dataset that origins from Kaggle. 

My objective is to create a model that predicts the survival rate of a titanic passenger.

Dependencies :

Python3

Numpy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Supervised Learning

Machine Learning Algorithm

Classification Algorithms
    
This notebook will consists of the following sub chapter :

A. Data handling (importing)

B. Exploratory Data Analysis (descriptive statistics)

C. Data Preparation (cleaning and splitting)

D. Data Training

E. Data Visualization

P.S. Please drop a star if it benefits you !
